In our problem we have a thin plate of dimensions a×b that is insulated along its long sides while the left side is embedded in ice-water and right right side is exposed to air.A heating element passes through the centre of the plate, we will consider this heating element to be a wire with 1500 watts heat output.We take initial temperature of the plate to be the room temperature 25 ◦ C , the temperature of the ice to be 0 ◦ C C and the temperature of the air in the room to be 27 ◦ . We assume that the plate is small so that it does not change the temperature of the air and ice, such that the air and ice act as a sink for heat, that is, it only absorbs the heat from the plate. Since by defination a square is a rectangle with equal sides then I have a = b we make the problem simpler and we also took the plate to be copper with thermal diffusivity 1.1234 × 10^ −4 .
